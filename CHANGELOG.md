# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [21.1.7]

### Added
- Support for team stages implementation in FTB Teams 2101.1.8
  - Player-based stages are still checked for, but teams stage of same name is also checked if player stage not present
  - Team stages can be queried/modified with the `/ftbteams teamstage` command

### Fixed
- JEI searches for potions or other items with component data now check for the component data
  - Avoids extraneous results when searching on such items
- Prevent client crash if data in `local/ftbechoes/*.snbt` is corrupted
  - Now just logs an error and proceeds with default persisted client data

## [21.1.6]

### Added
- Audio clips now continue playing after the Echo UI is closed
  - Players can hold Alt key down for 2 seconds (inside or outside the UI) to stop any playing audio clip
- Localization for audio clips used in `ftbechoes:audio` lore entries
  - The mod first looks for a clip under the `<lang>` subdirectory (where `<lang>` is the current language for the game) then under `en_us`,
  - e.g. `ftb:clip1` will be checked for in `assets/ftb/sounds/<lang>/clip1.ogg`, then in `assets/ftb/sounds/en_us/clip1.ogg`, then finally `assets/ftb/sounds/clip1.ogg`
- Optional `max_stage` entry for shop entries to allow items from older stages to be removed from the shop for teams beyond a given stage
- Added `pt_br` translation (thanks @PrincessStellar)
- Max claims for a shop item can now optionally be per-player instead of per-team
  - New `per_player_max_claims` boolean field (default false) in shop entry json
- Added `/ftbechoes nbtedit <player>` admin command to view/edit a player's team's echo progression
  - Take care with this: bad edits can wreck progression for a team! Make backups!

### Changed
- If no stage of an echo defines any shop entries, the "Shop" tab is now simply not displayed
- The current GUI tab ("Lore" or "Shop") is now tracked on a per-echo basis instead of being global to all echoes
- The `shop_unlock` field in the echo definition is now optional, defaulting to an empty list

### Changed
- Now using the "Voice" category for echo audio clips
